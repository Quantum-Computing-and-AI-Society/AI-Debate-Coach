Too many filler words? Too many pauses? Hand gestures are weak? This repository documents the work behind a real-time ML model that analyzes the speech of an individual and critics for betterment.

Steps to follow:
  1.) Understand what possible flaws someone can have in their speeches.
  2.) How can we analyze/ find these flaws from a small 30-second video of the person speaking.
  3.) What type of speech recognition and computer vision models to use.
  4.) Collection of data: small clips of people giving speeches with a specific (only 1) problem in each clip.
  5.) Feeding the data and testing the model.
  6.) Figuring out how to get it synchronized and do active leaarning.
